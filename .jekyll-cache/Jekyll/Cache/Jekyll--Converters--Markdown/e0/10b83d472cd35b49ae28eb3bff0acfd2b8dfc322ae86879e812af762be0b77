<p>Youâ€™ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<h3 id="ì†Œì œëª©">ì†Œì œëª©</h3>
<p>â€‹<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ì½”ë“œë¸”ëŸ­ python
def print_hi(name):
  print("hello", name)
print_hi('Tom')
â€‹</code></p>
